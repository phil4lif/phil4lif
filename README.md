### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer residing in Phoenix.  
I am currently available for a full time position.  

I'm working on a side project with a friend, it's a react native app that has something to do with foodtrucks and their customers.

I have a certificate from the University of Arizona's 24 week full stack bootcamp.  

I like working on coding projects and playing music.
